  <h1>Our Service</h1>
  <p>Whether it’s your first time or you’ve planned events before, it takes time, vendor relationships and experience to execute an amazing celebration. It can be overwhelming when you don’t know where to start, who to call and how far in advance you should be doing these tasks. Staying on budget, tracking RSVPs and managing all of the little details is a daunting task when you don’t have the right resources or help to do it.

    Whether you need just a bit of guidance or are looking for the full planning package, we can help. We look forward to hearing from you and creating an event your team will remember for years to come.</p>
